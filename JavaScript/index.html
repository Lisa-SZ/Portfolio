<!-- AM
! Tasks:
? 1: Create  new html & JS documents, and link them together
? 2: Create a variable that stores your name, using string concatenation I would like you to construct a string and use an alert to display the greeting to the user e.g. “Hello John”.
? 3: Create additional variables to store your favourite colour and your favourite film or tv series. Using string concatenation construct and log a sentence including your name and these values to the console.
? 4: Create variables storing what you ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner yesterday and log them to the console. I then want you to update the values for the "breakfast", "lunch" and dinner "variables" to what you are eating today and log the new values to the console.
-->

<!-- PM
! Tasks:
? 1: Research prompt, and use it to to take in a users name, using the value I would like you log a message to the console greeting them. Ensure it is formatted using a template literal.
? 2: Use prompt to take in a number, I would like you to multiply that number by 10 and then display an alert containing the result.
? 3: Research the JavaScript "Math" object and utilise the in-built methods to achieve the following:
? - Take a decimal number (e.g. 1.5) and round it to its nearest integer (whole number).
? - Take a decimal number (e.g. 1.5) and round it DOWN to its nearest integer (whole number).
? - Generate a random number between 1 and 10.
-->

<!-- AM
! Tasks:
? 1: Write a conditional statement to check whether a customer is old enough to be served alchohol at a bar. Check the value of a variable named "age" and log a message to the console asking what the customer would like if they are 18 or older and denying them service otherwise.
? 2: Create a conditional statement to compare 2 numbers, and check which is larger
? 3: Create a conditional statement to check if a number is even or odd
? 4: Create a conditional statement that will check if a number is higher than 5, 10, 20, 50 % 100
Only output the largest applicable number
? 5: Create a conditional statemnt to play FizzBuzz with a single variable
Fizzbuzz replaces multiples of 3 with 'Fizz', multiples of 5 with 'buzz' and multiples of both with 'fizzbuzz'
? 6: Add a check for non number data types, to filter them out from our fizzbuzz app

TASKS 
EASY
1. Create an array with at least 5 elements. Create a loop to output them to console
2. Create a loop that counts up to 50 from 0 in increments of 5
3. Create a loop to count to 500 in increasing increments

INTERMEDIATE
1. Create a loop that alternates between adding two & subtracting one, until it reaches 20
Bonus points if you can make it cut off exactly at 20
Hint: you may need to implement some things we covered yesterday
2. Create a loop that alternates counting up or down by increasing increments, stopping when it reaches +50 or -50
3. Create a loop to show the first 20 numbers of the fibbonacci sequence
4. Create a loop to play FizzBuzz
Can be done multiple ways
For fizzbuzz, we count from 1-100, replacing multiples of 3 wit "fizz", multiple of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 & 5 with "Fizzbuzz"
-->

<!-- 
Task 1: Create functions for add, subtract, multiply & divide
task 2: create a function to see if a number is even or odd
2-2: account for the possibility of the user inputting a non-number
-->

<!-- MORE TASKS
1. Create a function that adds two numbers together, subtracts that number from a third, then multiplies the result by another number. Use your basic operation functions
2. Create a function to add two pairs of numbers together, then multiply the two results together
3a. Create a function to play fizzbuzz with a single number, with the aim to expand it in the future
3b. Add a condition for 'bang' to be added on all multiples of 7
4a. Create a function to calculate change that should be paid after a transaction
4b. Modify your function so it can be extended to work for any currency
-->

<!-- 
! JavaScript Objects Tasks:
? 1: Create an object called ‘person’ with keys of name age and city. Once created log your object to the console.
? 2: Add a method to your ‘person’ object that returns a string greeting the person by name.
? 3: Update the values of your ‘person’ object with dot notation to familiarise yourself with how new values can be set to an object.
! Nested Objects – Stretch Tasks:
* Use the nested objects at the bottom of the reference file to complete the tasks below. Reference the requested data via the nested objects and log it to the console.
? 1: Log the name of John's supervisor to the console.
? 2: Log the title of 'The Great Gatsby' to the console.
TODO: If you manage to complete all of the tasks, have a go at creating your own nested object.

MORE TASKS
1. Create at least 3 objects for vehicles, each with at least 3 attributes, including top speed
2. Place your vehicles in an array
3. Create a loop to find the fastest vehicle in your garage. Output the fastest in a template literal
4. Add a fourth vehicle with a higher top speed. Does everything still work?
-->

<!-- 
1a. Create a function to add text to your page
1b. Add a button to your page to trigger your function
2a. Create a new page with text on it, and styling classes for light & dark mode
2b. Write a function which can be applied to a button, to toggle between light & dark mode
3. Add buttons to your page to increase & decrease your counter by 1, 5 & 10
HTML content is already prepared
4. Create a input field & button to allow users to submit text to your page
This will require some research
If stuck, look into the value attribute
4b. Alter your function so that each post has a background colour
